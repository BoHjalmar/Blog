## Look at it

I recently discovered [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/), and I'm already a big fan. Look what it can do!

$$
\frac{250}{5^2}
$$

Not impressive enough?

$$
E=mc^2
$$

Come on!

$$
F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
$$

I know. This is the greatest idea of all time: Combining blogging with _math_! I am aware of the fact that not everyone's favorite subject is mathematics, but I like it. Once again, deal with it.

$$
\left(\frac{x^2}{3y^2-2} \right)^2
$$

You still think it's worth a "meh"?

$$
n \in\mathbb N

\\

\sum_{i = 1}^n -1^{i+1} + 2i
$$

I will still blog about programming, too. But expect fancy formulas buried in the posts.

```javascript
var skills = new Set();

skills.add("javascript"); // That's what you are reading

while (!skills.has("math")) {
  await study("math");

  skills.add("math");
}
```
