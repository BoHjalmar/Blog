Yesterday, my family bought a bird table that we put outside of our kitchen window. Many species have come, even a [great spotted woodpecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_spotted_woodpecker) tried to grab some food. That reminds me about the birds in Star Stable. That is a wonderful experience with birds, bees, dragonfly and butterflies. It's fun that they have come to Silverglade and Mistfall, and I wish that they came to all the other places in Jorvik. Except for Dino Valley, they would probably not blend in very well. I guess that's all I had for this time. Bye!
